Samba VFS HOWTO
===============

How to build the VFS module binaries for a new Samba version.
(Mostly, notes to self...)

1. Create a new `samba-module/wscript-samba-$VERSION.patch` ; modify as needed.

2. Create a new `samba-module/vfs_greyhole-samba-$VERSION.c` ; modify as needed.

3. Copy those two new files into `vfs_greyhole-samba-4.x.c` and `wscript-samba-4.x.patch`

4. Add the new Samba version number in `build/build_vfs_all.sh` @L18

5. Run the `sudo build/build_vfs_all.sh` script

6. Edit `INSTALL`
    - Change latest version of Samba supported in point 3 (near L86, and in the two `cp` lines slightly below).

7. Edit `DEBIAN/Makefile`
    - Add lines near L116, L148, L170

8. Edit `DEBIAN/postinst`
    - Add an `elif` block near L104, and change the `else` block to use the latest version

9. Commit all changes & new binaries
   See [this commit](https://github.com/gboudreau/Greyhole/commit/7d5a46aa35392e524ac8ef8a360a9544219a446a) for an example of what your commit should contain.
